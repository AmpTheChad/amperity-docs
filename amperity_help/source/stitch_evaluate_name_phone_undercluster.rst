.. tooltip-stitch-name-phone-undercluster-start

This test computes, for every (name, phone) combination, a ratio of how many such combinations appear in multiple Amperity IDs, vs. only one Amperity ID. A large ratio implies that the same (name, phone) are being spread across multiple Amperity IDs more than expected, which may indicate under-clustering.
