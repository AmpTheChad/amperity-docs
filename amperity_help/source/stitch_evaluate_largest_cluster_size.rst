.. tooltip-stitch-largest-cluster-size-start

This test computes the percentage of a tenant's stitched records that are associated the largest Amperity ID. A larger percentage implies many records are being clustered into the same Amperity ID, usually because of bogus PII values. If, upon inspection, the largest cluster looks good, you may ignore this test.
