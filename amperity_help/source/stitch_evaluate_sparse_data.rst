.. tooltip-stitch-sparse-data-start

This test computes the percentage of stitched records that are considered sparse, which is defined as not having an email or given name value. A larger percentage means that there's less rich PII going into Stitch than we'd expect, and usually implies a problem with data capture or semantic tagging.
