To filter your audience based on their attributes, add sub-audiences. By default customers will only be included in the first sub-audience they match on this page. To include customers in every sub-audience they match, turn the "Assign to first match only" toggle off. You may also use groups to send a percentage of each sub-audience to specified destinations.
