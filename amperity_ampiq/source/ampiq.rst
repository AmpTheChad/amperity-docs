Sending campaigns
==================================================

.. campaigns-static-intro-start

Sending campaigns from Amperity is a combination of three things: segments, audiences, and destinations. The following series of topics describes how these work.

* A :doc:`segment <segments>` defines the audience that you will use with your campaign.
* A :doc:`campaign <campaigns>` breaks that audience down into sub-audiences that align to your marketing strategies and goals.
* :doc:`Destinations <destinations>` are the locations and channels to which you will send those sub-audiences, after which you will perform specific marketing activities to support your marketing campaign.
