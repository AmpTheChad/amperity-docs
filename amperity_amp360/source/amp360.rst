About Amp360
==================================================

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst

.. amp360-start

A user of Amp360 should be comfortable using SQL to build databases and tables, design queries, understand what is required to synchronize a dataset with external systems and workflows (both upstream and downstream), and how to use attributes available from within Amperity to help their organizations learn more about their customers.

.. _amp360-common-workflows:

Common workflows
==================================================

.. amp360-common-workflows-start

The most common workflows for Amp360 focus on data and databases, writing SQL to define queries and enable workflows, and interacting with attributes (both those output by Stitch and those generated by the ways semantic tags were applied to data sources in your tenant).

Use Amp360 to:

* Build your customer 360
* Use SQL to define multiple databases, custom databases, and custom tables
* Extend your customer 360 to make use of vertical-specific attributes and to define your own custom attributes
* Explore data using the Data Explorer

The SQL query editor enable workflows, such as:

* Linking the Amperity ID (first-party) to third-party provider person IDs
* Enriching third-party non-PII data for customer analysis, segmentation, and targeting
* Standardizing data for certain PII details
* Using data hygiene to verify accuracy of PII with third-party data providers
* Linking unknown IDs to known customers
* Mapping unknown users to known customers
* Mapping anonymous users to known customers

.. _amp360-customer360:

Customer 360 database
==================================================

.. amp360-customer360-start

The customer 360 database is the most important database you can build in Amperity. It is the source from which all queries and segments are created and from which data will be sent to external systems for downstream workflows.

.. amp360-customer360-end


.. _amp360-flexible-merge-rules:

Flexible merge rules
--------------------------------------------------

.. amp360-flexible-merge-rules-start

Some customer data platforms require using an inflexible merge rule across multiple fields, which results in lower quality data across your customer 360 profile. This problem is magnified when that inflexible merge rule must also be applied to multiple customer 360 databases.

Amperity combines the use of flexible merge rules with a patented system that allows multiple customer 360 databases to exist within the same tenant. This ensures that:

#. Merge rules are 100% configurable
#. Each field can have its own merge rule
#. Each customer 360 database can have its own set of merge rules
#. Each tenant can support a variety of merge rules to meet all of the requirements for any individual use case

For example, data sources from call centers, online transactions, and email platforms may contain slightly different sets of customer profile data.

   :alt: Use flexible merge rules to support many customer 360 databases.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

After loading this data to Amperity and assigning the Amperity ID to each of your customers, you can use flexible merge rules to support multiple customer 360 databases.

* Your operations teams can combine prioritizing the most common values for each customer with deterministic matching
* Your email marketing team can combine prioritizing customer profile values from your email platform with probabilistic matching
* Your paid media team can combine all possible values to improve match rates on platforms like Google Ads and Facebook

Ask your Amperity implementation team for recommendations and best practices for how you can configure flexible merge rules to support all of your use cases.

There are four groups of tables in this diagram:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 100 500
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Group name
     - Description

   * - Customer records

       .. image:: ../../images/data_tables-customer-records.png
          :width: 20 px
          :alt: The color associated with the customer profile table group.

          :class: no-scaled-link
     - .. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
          :start-after: .. term-customer-profile-start
          :end-before: .. term-customer-profile-end

       The **Customer 360** table represents your primary set of customer profiles and is the most common starting point for building segments. Each customer profile is built using a combination of the **Merged Customers**, **Unified Customer**, and **Unified Coalesced** tables.

   * - Interaction records

       .. image:: ../../images/data_tables-interaction-records.png
          :width: 20 px
          :alt: The color associated with the interaction records table group.
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link
     - .. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
          :start-after: .. term-interaction-record-start
          :end-before: .. term-interaction-record-end

       Interaction records rely on a series of tables: **Transaction Attributes**, **Transaction Attributes Extended**, **Unified Itemized Transactions**, **Unified Transactions**, and **Unified Product Catalog**.

       Each Amperity ID in the **Customer 360** table can be associated to many rows in the **Unified Transactions** table, and then each Amperity ID in the **Unified Transactions** can be associated to many rows in the **Unified Itemized Transactions** table. Each Amperity ID in the **Customer 360** table is associated to one Amperity ID in the **Transaction Attributes** table.

       .. note:: The **Transaction Attributes** table has an associated "extended" table that captures additional attributes when data sources provide to Amperity the data required to complete the calculations for the attributes. It exists as a separate table in the customer 360 database, but should be viewed as a subset of transactions attributes data.

   * - Stitch results

       .. image:: ../../images/data_tables-stitch-results.png
          :width: 20 px
          :alt: The color associated with the Stitch results table group.
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link
     - .. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
          :start-after: .. term-stitch-qa-start
          :end-before: .. term-stitch-qa-end

       Stitch QA activities rely on a series of tables: **Unified Coalesced**, **Unified Scores**, **Detailed Examples**, **Unified Preprocessed Raw**, **Unified Changes Clusters**, and **Unified Changes PKs**. These tables are the basis for the Stitch QA process; the specific use of individual tables will vary from tenant to tenant. Together they provide visibility into how Amperity grouped (or did not group) individual customer records to a single Amperity ID.

   * - AmpIQ

       .. image:: ../../images/data_tables-ampiq.png
          :width: 20 px
          :alt: The color associated with the AmpIQ table group.
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link
     - .. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
          :start-after: .. term-ampiq-start
          :end-before: .. term-ampiq-end

       AmpIQ tables are enabled for users of AmpIQ and are the results of the configuration and tuning of Amperity for predictive analytics. These tables rely on the **Merged Customers**, **Unified Itemized Transactions**, and **Unified Transactions** tables for predictions, but there is not a 1:1 or 1:many relationship between those three tables and AmpIQ tables. The **Predicted CLV Attributes** table contains one row per Amperity ID, whereas the **Affinity** and **Recommendation** tables contain many rows per Amperity ID.

       The **Campaign Recipients** table contains a history of all campaigns that have been sent from Amperity. This table is updated on a recurring basis and may be used like any other table in your customer 360 database.

.. _amp360-queries-tab:

Queries
==================================================

.. amp360-queries-tab-start

Queries enable you to discover lists of customers, get insight into their preferences and habits, identify properties and characteristics of that list, and then use that list to initiate marketing actions, campaigns, and other downstream workflows.

Queries also enable you to write SQL that can be used to perform QA against various databases and tables in the customer 360 database.

.. amp360-queries-tab-end

   :width: 600 px
   :alt: The Queries page in Amperity.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

.. amp360-queries-tab-sql-interfaces-start

The **Queries** page provides a SQL interface for building queries. Use the visual editor to build queries with drop-downs and picklists. Use the SQL editor (and Presto SQL) to build more advanced queries. The **Queries** page keeps a list of all queries, in both active and draft states.

Both editors can access all tables in the customer 360 database, which contains all of your important customer attributes, along with passthrough tables that bring data that was pulled to Amperity from the domain tables to the customer 360.

.. _amp360-send-to-downstream-workflows:

Send to downstream workflows
==================================================

.. amp360-send-to-downstream-workflows-start

You can send data from the customer 360 database to any downstream location or workflow. There are two ways to do send data:

#. By using Presto SQL to send only data that is returned by a query to a configured destination
#. By exporting a database or a table
