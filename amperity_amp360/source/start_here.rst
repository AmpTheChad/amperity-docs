About this topic collection
==================================================

.. start-here-about-this-collection-start

The left-side navigation (from top to bottom) in this topic collection uses a verb-based approach to loosely organize around the series of actions that you may do when building queries, and then sending those results to downstream workflows.

The left-side navigation has sections for the following types of activities:

#. Reviewing Stitch results and ID resolution.
#. Viewing databases in the **Customer 360** page.
#. Building queries using Presto SQL. These queries can support any desired use case.
#. Analyzing campaign results to support AmpIQ users, if AmpIQ is enabled for your tenant.
#. Sending query results to any downstream workflow, including to BI tools such as Tableau, Microsoft Dynamics, and Business Intelligence Connect.

.. _start-here-example-workflow:

Example workflow
==================================================

.. start-here-example-workflow-start

Amperity standard output tables provide the foundation for a complete view of your customer. Use queries to return any type of results, and then send those results to any destination.

The numbers in the previous diagram represent a scenario that builds a query, and then sends results to a configured destination:

#. Open Amperity and review databases and tables.
#. Build a query that returns the right set of data to support your downstream workflow.
#. Send the results of that query to any configured destination. (Query results are sent to a single destination.)
